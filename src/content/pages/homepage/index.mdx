I'm Anik Das, an MSc Data Science & AI student at BITS Pilani (Digital). I love transforming messy data into clear, actionable insights and building practical AI-powered tools that solve real problems.

My toolkit includes Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn. I enjoy end-to-end work: EDA, feature engineering, model training/evaluation, and shipping lightweight data apps. Recently, I’ve been exploring Generative AI and LLMs for retrieval-augmented generation and workflow automation.

Previously, I completed a BSc in Data Science from MAKAUT with a CGPA of 8.3, along with certifications from Microsoft, Meta, and Coursera in Python, analytics, and AI.

I'm open to roles as a data analyst or junior data scientist, as well as internships and project collaborations. Let’s connect!
